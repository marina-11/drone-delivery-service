# drone-delivery-service
Devised and implemented an algorithm to control the flight of a drone as it collects orders and makes deliveries while avoiding pre-specified "no-fly" zones.

Menu data, "no-fly" zone and landmark locations data, and What3Words data were found in a web server. <br />
The order details and the orders made on each date were found in an Apache Derby database.
